Employee Management System Project 👨‍💻 | Core Java | 🎬 Hello everyone, I am excited to share my task 1 video of an employee management system using core java.
The Employee Management System is a command-line-based and user-friendly application designed using core Java classes to streamline and automate various processes within an organization. It provides a centralized platform for managing employee information, tracking details, updating information about employees, and much more.

Key Features: The user can easily add new employee details, and display the detailed list of existing employees. Users can search the employee details by using their id. The user can also update the employee details and delete as well.
Technical highlights: Core Java, Arraylist, Packages, etc..

Learning experience: Throughout this task I learned the concept of Java classes, looping statements like while and do while loop. Conditional statements - if, if-else, and switch case statements.
I also learned about ArrayList and iterator. Managing source code and version control tool (GitHub).
